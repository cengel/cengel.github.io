We review our experiences in teaching a Stanford Introductory Seminar that uses the case of the cigarette industry to investigate how a worldwide fount of disease and death comes to be made legible/illegible and how we might reenvision it. 

Heavy emphasis is placed upon practical learning and data visualization. Reenvisioning the tobacco industry is a hands-on activity. Students create a novel "critical industry visualization" (CIV) that depicts aspects of cigarette manufacturing, how it is occluded from public scrutiny, or how alternative politics about cigarette manufacturersâ€™ complicity in tobacco-induced death might be generated. 

Sucessful visualizations are made available online for a public audience.
