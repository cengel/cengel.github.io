Until now, much global health research and intervention in the area of tobacco has focused on the consumer - addressing how one or another variable prompts people to take up or quit smoking, whether the cue for the consumer is biological, psychological, spatial, financial or symbolic. 

The [Cigarette Citadels project](https://web.stanford.edu/group/tobaccoprv/cgi-bin/wp/) pushes attention away from the consumer, toward the surfeit of cigarette factories in the world and the profusion of harmful products they roll out. This is a direction for study and health promotion that tobacco companies have been eager to avoid.

We take the case of the cigarette industry to investigate how a worldwide fount of disease and death comes to be made legible and illegible at the same time and how we might reenvision it.
