title: "What We Expect From Students"
---

Reenvisioning the tobacco industry is a hands-on activity for all seminar participants.  Nurtured by weekly in-class workshopping sessions, each seminar participant is required to create a novel “critical industry visualization” (CIV). 

Each CIV is an internet-hostable project depicting in a unique way some of the following questions:

  - What is cigarette manufacturing?
  
  - By what means is cigarette manufacturing occluded from public scrutiny?
  
  - How might an alternative politics about cigarette manufacturers’ complicity in tobacco-induced death be generated?

Successful CIVs are invited for long-term hosting on Stanford’s Cigarette Citadels website (https://web.stanford.edu/group/tobaccoprv/cgi-bin/wp/).
