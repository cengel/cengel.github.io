title: "How We Help"
---

We taught the class in two consecutive years, Spring Quarter 2015 and Winter Quarter 2016.

- The 2015 class had 10 students, 2 teachers and guests as reviewers
- The 2016 class had 8 students, 3 teaching staff and guests as reviewers.

We structure the class into:

- discussion of substantive readings
- workshopping with peer review and feedback
- public viewing and feedback from outside audience

In addition we provide:

- visualization examples (good and bad) 
- suggestions for tools
- tech support and troubleshooting
